## Introduction

Welcome to the SNARK Challenge! By participating, you're joining researchers, engineers, students, and hackers from around the world to try and improve the world's cryptography commons. Along the way, you'll learn about zk-SNARKs, a cutting-edge cryptographic primitive that's being used widely in blockchain and cryptocurrency applications. You'll also implement numerical algorithms on high performance computing platforms.

### Background

zk-SNARKs have been developing rapidly in the past few years, and in crypto they’re one of the most promising ways to bring scalability and privacy to blockchains. But in many ways we’re still at the surface of what’s possible. We've developed this challenge to improve SNARKs in three specific ways:

- [SNARK Prover](https://coinlist.co/build/coda/pages/prover). SNARK provers will become dramatically faster when they are implemented on GPUs, since many of the computational steps involved in SNARK proving are perfectly parallelizable. We're offering $70,000 in prizes to speed up the SNARK prover.
- [SNARK Verifier](https://coinlist.co/build/coda/pages/verifier). Verifying SNARK circuits is computationally inexpensive, so we think it should be accessible to everyone. We're offering a $10k prize for the fastest implementation of a SNARK verifier in JavaScript.
- [Elliptic Curve Search](https://coinlist.co/build/coda/pages/theory). The elliptic curves underlying SNARK constructions may be improved, which could dramatically improve the efficiency of the prover. The highest quality ellptic curve construction will receive a $20k prize.

### Who should participate

You don't need a background in cryptography to participate in this challenge. Below, we've described the type of backgrounds we think would be most helpful in completing each of the challenges

- [Snark Prover](https://coinlist.co/build/coda/pages/prover). If you have a background in GPU or other high performance computing or you want to learn, this challenge is for you. We've described the mechanics of the SNARK prover construction, provided reference code, and developed a tutorial to get you started. The first teams who implement SNARKs on GPUs will be eligible for up to $70k in prizes, with an additional $5k in rewards for completing the tutorial.
- [Snark Verifier](https://coinlist.co/build/coda/pages/verifier). This challenge is best for those who can write optimized JavaScript code. We've described how to implement the verifier, and are offering a $10k reward for the fastest version.
- [Elliptic Curve Search](https://coinlist.co/build/coda/pages/theory). Those with a background in cryptography or those who have access to lots of compute are best qualified for this challenge. We've described the parameters of the curve search and how to submit new curves for evaluation. The highest quality curve construction will receive a $20k prize.
