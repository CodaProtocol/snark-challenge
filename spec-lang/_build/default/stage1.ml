paid to do it? Then you're in the right place.

In this stage, you'll implement the sub-algorithms you need to
implement the full SNARK prover and you'll get paid to do so.
The first 10 participants who complete the four challenges in this stage
will receive $200 and a *SNARK Challenge* swag-bag.
They'll also be very well positioned to apply their solutions to
create submissions for $55,000 of the $75,000 in prizes up for grabs in the second stage.

Let's dive into it and give a quick overview of the SNARK prover so
we have an idea of where we're going. The SNARK prover itself
consists of two sub-algorithms: 

1. Multi-exponentiation on an elliptic curve.
2. Fast fourier transform (FFT) over a finite field.

The cool thing about both of these algorithms is that they're massively
parallel and ideally suited to implementation on GPU, which we expect to
help take the top prize in the challenge. The multi-exponentiation in
particular is just a big [reduction](https://developer.download.nvidia.com/assets/cuda/files/reduction.pdf),
although the reduction function requires some work to describe.

These 2 algorithms themselves have sub-algorithms which you'll need to implement first.
In total, the first stage has 4 challenges. After implementing these challenges you'll
be well on your way to having a complete GPU implementation of the SNARK prover itself.|md}

    {md|Welcome to the SNARK challenge! The SNARK challenge is divided
up into two stages. In the first stage, you'll get your feet wet and
learn about the algorithms underlying the SNARK prover.
Think of this stage as a paid training for the ultimate challenge
of writing a super-fast SNARK prover. There are $5,000 in prizes in
this stage.

The second stage is the main stage of the competition.
There are $95,000 in prizes including $55,000 for speeding up the
[Groth16 prover](%s) and $20,000 for developing better cryptographic
primitives. Here you'll apply GPU programming and techniques for
speeding up elliptic-curve and finite-field arithmetic to try
to build the fastest possible [Groth16 prover](%s).

## Stage 1

Want to learn cutting edge cryptography, GPU programming and get
paid to do it? Then you're in the right place.

In this stage, you'll implement the sub-algorithms you need to

## The stage 2 challenges

This is the main stage of the challenge with a total of $95,000 in prizes.
The challenges break into two categories: implementation and theory. Let's
start with implementation.

### Implementation challenges
