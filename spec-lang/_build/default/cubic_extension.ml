you can safely skip this section.

A field extension of a field $\mathbb{F}$ is another field $\mathbb{F}'$
which contains $\mathbb{F}$. To use a familiar example, $\mathbb{R}$,
the field of real numbers is a field extension of the field $\mathbb{Q}$
of rational numbers.

In the SNARK challenge and in cryptography in general, we work with finite
fields, and the extension fields we'll consider will be finite fields as
well.

In this problem, you'll implement a kind of extension called a cubic extension.
The idea is the following. First we'll start
with our prime order field $\mathbb{F}_q$ where $q$ is %s. Then, we'll
pick a number in $\mathbb{F}_q$ which does not have a cube root in
$\mathbb{F}_q$. In our case, we'll use $11$.
If you already completed [the quadratic extension](%s), this problem is
very similar.

Now we can define the field we call $\mathbb{F}_q[x] / (x^3 = 11)$. This is the field
obtained by adding an "imaginary" cube root $x$ for $11$ to $\mathbb{F}_q$. It's a lot like how
the complex numbers are constructed from the real numbers by adding an "imaginary" square root
$i$ for $-1$ to $\mathbb{R}$.

Similar to the complex numbers, the elements of $\mathbb{F}_q[x] / (x^3 = 11)$ are sums
of the form $a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2$ where $a_0, a_1, a_2$ are elements of $\mathbb{F}_q$. This is a
field extension of $\mathbb{F}_q$ since $\mathbb{F}_q$ is contained in this field as
the elements with $a_1 = a_2 = 0$. For short, we call this field $\mathbb{F}_{q^3}$ since it
has $q^3$ elements.|md}

struct `{ a0 : Fq, a1 : Fq, a2 : Fq }`.

This problem will have you implement multiplication for $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$.

## Definitions and review
Let's review what exactly a field extension is. The actual operations

A field extension of a field $\mathbb{F}$ is another field $\mathbb{F}'$

pick a number in $\mathbb{F}_q$ which does not have a cube root in
$\mathbb{F}_q$. In our case, we'll use $11$.
If you already completed [the quadratic extension](%s), this problem is
very similar.

Now we can define the field we call $\mathbb{F}_q[x] / (x^3 = 11)$. This is the field
obtained by adding an "imaginary" cube root $x$ for $11$ to $\mathbb{F}_q$. It's a lot like how
the complex numbers are constructed from the real numbers by adding an "imaginary" square root

Similar to the complex numbers, the elements of $\mathbb{F}_q[x] / (x^3 = 11)$ are sums
of the form $a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2$ where $a_0, a_1, a_2$ are elements of $\mathbb{F}_q$. This is a
field extension of $\mathbb{F}_q$ since $\mathbb{F}_q$ is contained in this field as
the elements with $a_1 = a_2 = 0$. For short, we call this field $\mathbb{F}_{q^3}$ since it
has $q^3$ elements.

## The problem

In code, you can think of an element of $\mathbb{F}_{q^3}$ as a tuple
`(a0, a1, a2)` where
each of `a0`, `a1`, `a2` is an element of $\mathbb{F}_q$ or a
struct `{ a0 : Fq, a1 : Fq, a2 : Fq }`.

This problem will have you implement multiplication for $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$.

(a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2) (b_0 + b_1 x + b_2 x^2)
&= a_0 b_0 + a_0 b_1 x + a_0 b_2 x^2
+ a_1 b_0 x + a_1 b_1 x^2 + a_1 b_2 x^3

&= a_0 b_0 + a_0 b_1 x + a_0 b_2 x^2
+ a_1 b_0 x + a_1 b_1 x^2 + 11 a_1 b_2 
+ a_2 b_0 x^2 + 11 a_2 b_1 + 11 a_2 b_2 x \\
&= (a_0 b_0 + 11 a_1 b_2 + 11 a_2 b_1)
+ (a_0 b_1 + a_1 b_0 + 11 a_2 b_2) x
+ (a_0 b_2 + a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_0) x^2 \\
