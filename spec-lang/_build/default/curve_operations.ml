Fix a field $\mathbb{F}$. For example, one of the fields described
on the parameter pages for [MNT4-753](%s) and [MNT6-753](%s).
Then fix numbers $a, b$ in $\mathbb{F}$. The set of points $(x, y)$ such that
$y^2 = x^3 + a x + b$ is called an elliptic curve over the field $\mathbb{F}$.

Elliptic curves are the essential tool powering SNARKs. They're useful because
we can define a kind of "addition" of points on a given curve. This is also
called the "group operation" for the curve.
Let's define this "addition" as follows using pseudocode, where `+, *, /` are
all taking place in the field $\mathbb{F}$.

```javascript

var curve_add = (p, q) => {
  var s = (p.y - q.y) / (p.x - q.x);
  var x = s*s - p.x - q.x;
  return {
    x: x,
    y: s*(p.x - x) - p.y
  };
};
```
Note that this definition doesn't work in the case that `p.x = q.x`. This case
splits into the case `p.y = q.y` (in which case its called "doubling" and
there is a separate formula) and the case `p.y = -q.y` in which case a special
"identity" value should be returned.

For efficiency, one uses a different, more complicated
formula for adding curve points. This will be discussed in
the techniques section below.|md}

## Coordinate systems

Points in the form $(x, y)$ as above are said to be
represented using *affine coordinates*
and the above definition is *affine* curve addition.

There are more efficient ways of adding
curve points which use different coordinate systems.
The most efficient of these is called
*Jacobian coordinates*. Formulas for addition and doubling in Jacobian
coordinates can be found [here](https://www.hyperelliptic.org/EFD/g1p/auto-shortw-jacobian.html#doubling-dbl-2007-bl)
and a Rust implementation [here](https://github.com/CodaProtocol/pairing/blob/mnt46-753/src/mnt4_753/ec.rs#L374).

There is a further technique called "mixed addition" which allows one to add
a point in Jacobian coordinates to a point in affine coordinates even more efficiently than adding
two points in Jacobian coordinates. This technique can yield large efficiency
gains but makes taking advantage of parallelism more complicated.

## Parallelism

This problem is an instance of a *reduction* and is inherently
parallel.
